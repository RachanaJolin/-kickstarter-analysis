Outcomes Based on Goals : The success of the project relates to the goal amount. The most succesful fundraising projects had a goal less than 1000. The highest failure percentages were in the goal higher than 50k group. 
Outcomes Based on Launch Dates : It appears that fundraising projects that were started in q2 and or q3 were more succesul. According to my analysis the 2015 Feb, May and June were good months to launch fundraising campaigns. 2014 through 2016 were good years overall for fundraising. I generated bar graph and line graph to see what would work best for data interpretation. 
There's another Sheet "outcomes based on Launch Date2 - I was playing with the year, quarter and months to see how it affected the graphs.
Questions  that this data raised : People's interest waned in 2017 ? Less fundraiding campaigns were started?
